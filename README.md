# LoremFlickr
LoremFlickr provides placeholder images for every case, web or print, on almost any subject, in any size. Visit http://loremflickr.com to see this in action.
## How to install
Put the files in the location of your choice. Enter your Flickr API and server details in initialize.php. Perhaps adjust the cache locations and make sure those folders are server-writable. 
Inside the includes folder, add dan-coulter's phpFlickr.
